# Backend_for_Complaints

USING web2py framework: and python and SQL, a backend server for the complaint management system which can be used in any college for the 
better Managament system and up/down vote mechanism with comments and feedback.

The end­users of the system will be the people of the institute such as faculties, students, and institute employees. 
Using this application, the end users can submit their complaint/grievance to the concerned authorities.
The application must allow for three type of complaints: 
1.	Individual complaint: A student wants to complain about the electricity problem in his hostel room to an electrician 
2.	Hostel­level complaint: Hostel residents want to complain about the bad quality of the mess food to their warden. 
3.	Institute­level complaint: Students across the institute want to protest against the LAN ban after 1 am 
 
In case of individual complaints, the end user's complaint is visible to the concerned authority only. Once the complaint is
addressed, the an user is able to mark it as resolved.  Consider the example of a student whose hostel room’s tube light is
not working properly. The student will file a complaint which will be visible to the electrician. Once the tube light is fixed, the
student should mark the issue as resolved. 
 
In case of a public complaint (Hostel­level or Institute­level), the end user's complaint is visible to all the people
who will be affected by the complais allowed to view and additionally give a vote(up/down) on the complaint. In such complaints,
the warden has the right to mark the complaint as resolved. Kindly note the difference here: in case of individual complaint,
the individual user was able to mark the complaint as resolved, while in case of a hostel complaint, the warden has the authority
to mark the complaint as resolved.
